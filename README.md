# Plant-Disease-Classifier

This project uses machine learning to detect diseases in plants. The goal is to classify images of plants into different disease categories using the **PlantVillage dataset**. The model can be used to help farmers and agriculture professionals identify plant diseases and take timely action.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **PlantVillage dataset** by Arjun Tejaswi, which contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

## Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training/testing sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model or pre-trained models like MobileNet for transfer learning.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model to classify plant diseases based on the images.
4. **Evaluation**: Model evaluation on test data and fine-tuning for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## Installation:
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qubitsculptor/Plant-Disease-Classifier.git
